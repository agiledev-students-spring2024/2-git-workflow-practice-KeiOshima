## My Comments 

This article, written by Verge, focuses on what AI can do and how it will impact the future of software engineers. The article claims that researchers at the US Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory claim that by 2040, AI will replace large amounts of software engineers. The author then goes on to state that a significant factor that many researchers believe is the wide variety of things AI can do for software engineers. For example, the article states that AI can do Testing and quality assurance, Code generation and optimization, DevOps, and continuous integration, to name a few. Furthermore, extensive AI tools and Frameworks already make it easier to build and train deep learning models like Pytorch and TensorFlow. What I found interesting, however, was that the article emphasizes that rather than trying to push back against AI, Software engineers, whether they like it or not, will have to level up their skill set if they want to keep up. The article states that knowledge in machine learning, natural language processing, neural networks, deep learning, and more will become more critical in the future. While I am not really into AI, it points out a fundamental part of being a software engineer: continuing to learn and grow no matter where you are in your career. Learning continues after graduation or getting that first job. The tech field is constantly changing, and there is always something new. 

## Ibrahim Sheikh's Comments 

It's interesting how there are so many predictions about where the world will be years from now but the truth is no one really knows. For example, prominent researchers thought the internet would be a much less change than it actually was. I don't think software developers will lose their jobs or be replaced by AI but rather they will benefit a lot from it. For instance, something that required five developers will now require one because AI can make people efficient and automate redundant work.
